Description

As a data scientist,
I want to run Rate Validation Analysis on newly pulled claims data sets based on top Kyruss/Aetna searches and high-value claims,
so that we can validate pricing accuracy and uncover patterns or anomalies in high-impact data.

Acceptance Criteria:
Data Preparation

New claims data sets are successfully pulled and documented.

Data sets are validated for completeness and readiness for analysis.

Rate Validation Execution

Rate Validation Analysis is run on each new data set.

Outputs are reviewed for consistency with V1 logic and formatting.

Insights & Reporting

Key findings (e.g., rate mismatches, outliers, trends) are documented.

Summary report is shared with stakeholders for review and feedback.

Follow-Up Actions

Any anomalies or issues identified are flagged for deeper investigation.

Recommendations for refining the analysis or data sources are captured.
