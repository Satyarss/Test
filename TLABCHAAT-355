Description

When retrieving rates, we need to consider the payment method hierarchy if multiple payment methods are available.

Payment method hierarchy table exist in spanner and we need to keep in cache. 

payment method hierarchy available only for non standard contract and default contract rates. 

If you are getting two payment method in result, we need to select lowest score and return rate for that payment method
